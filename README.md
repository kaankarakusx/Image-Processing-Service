Image Processing Service
========================

An Image Processing Service built with **TypeScript** and **Express**. This service allows users to upload images, apply various transformations, and retrieve modified images. The project is based on a [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) project idea, with some custom adjustments from the original specifications.

Features
--------

*   **Image Upload**: Allows users to upload images for processing.
*   **Image Processing**: Applies transformations like resizing, cropping, and format conversion based on user input.
*   **Image Retrieval**: Processed images are stored and can be retrieved later.

Technical Stack
---------------

*   **TypeScript**: Enables static typing and improves the development experience.
*   **Express**: Provides the backend framework for handling HTTP requests and managing image processing routes.

Installation
------------

To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies:

        `git clone <repository-url> cd image-processing-service npm install`
        
    

Usage
-----

1.  **Start the Server**: After installation, start the server with the following command:
    
                    `npm run start`
                
    
2.  **Upload Images**: Use an HTTP client (like Postman) to upload images to the specified endpoint.
3.  **Retrieve Processed Images**: After processing, images can be downloaded from the output endpoints.

Endpoints
---------

*   **POST `/api/v1/auth/register`**: Registers a new user.
*   **POST `/api/v1/auth/login`**: Authenticates a user and provides access to the system.
*   **POST `/api/v1/images`**: Uploads a new image for processing.
*   **PUT `/api/v1/images/:id/transform`**: Applies transformations to an existing image by its unique identifier.
*   **GET `/api/v1/images/:id`**: Retrieves a processed image by its unique identifier.
*   **GET `/api/v1/images/all`**: Retrieves all processed images.

Dependencies
------------

*   **Express**: Web framework for building the API.
*   **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads.
*   **Sharp**: Image processing library for resizing, cropping, and other transformations.

Future Improvements
-------------------

*   **Extend Processing Options**: Add more image transformations, such as watermarking and color adjustments.
*   **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and add validation to enforce robust user input checks.
