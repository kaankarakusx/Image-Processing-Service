Image Processing Service
This is an Image Processing Service built with TypeScript and Express. It allows users to upload images, apply various transformations, and retrieve the modified images. This project was created based on the roadmap.sh project idea, with some adjustments from the original specifications.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images to the service for processing.
Image Processing: The service applies transformations, such as resizing, cropping, and format conversions, based on user input.
Image Retrieval: Processed images are stored and can be retrieved later.

Technical Stack
TypeScript: Used for static typing and improved development experience.
Express: Provides the backend framework to handle HTTP requests and manage image processing routes.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone <repository-url>
cd image-processing-service
npm install

Usage
1-Start the Server: After installation, start the server using the following command:

npm run start

2-Upload Images: Use an HTTP client (like Postman) to upload images to the specified endpoint.

3-Retrieve Processed Images: Once processed, images can be downloaded from the output endpoints.


Endpoints
POST /upload: Accepts image files for processing.
GET /image/
: Retrieves a processed image by its unique identifier.
Dependencies
Express: Web framework for building the API.
Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads.
Sharp: Image processing library for resizing, cropping, and other transformations.
Future Improvements
Extend Processing Options: More image transformations, like watermarking and color adjustments, could be added.
Error Handling: Improve error handling and add validation for robust user input checks.
